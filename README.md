Course instructor: Dr. Jiaji Wang at cewang@hku.hk
## Course Description
This course is a postgraduate-level tutorial that introduces the theory and application of Generative AI across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and data science. The course will first illustrate existing examples and applications of Generative AI, helping students understand the foundational concepts and methodologies. Then, the course will delve into advanced topics, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion model, Transformer, and transformer-based Large Language Model api call. In the meantime, the course will demonstrate the application of Generative AI in solving real-world problems, such as image generation, text generation, and data augmentation.
Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be able to conduct the following:
- Formulating real-world applications into Generative AI problems and identify the related learning issues;
- Selecting and applying the most suitable methods to solve specific problems;
- Comparing different Generative AI approaches based on common performance criteria.
## Prerequisites
- Students are expected to have the following background:
- Obtained a Bachelor's degree in engineering or science;
- Basic knowledge in computer science and programming;
- Knowledge of basic machine learning principles. However, it is also ok if you are not familiar with deep learning. We will offer lectures and tutorials to teach you how to implement Generative AI models with Python.
- College-level calculus, linear algebra and matrix analysis, probability and statistical analysis.
